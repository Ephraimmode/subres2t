To run this file, download the zip file and extract the folder to your local server (xammp or Mamp), place the file on htdocs.
--------->
your local server needs to be running and then. access "localhost" through your browser 
--------->
you will need to create database name "subres_db"

the database configuration is located inside the includee folder named "new_config.php"
---------->
on the new_config.php, local server password is empty for xammp and the password will be 'root' for Mamp.

once the database is created, the sql file for the project is located inside the "db" folder. Kindly import it to your created database.

The setting up will be OK now from the above setup hits.

# PLANS AND APPROACH TO THE TEST PROJECT

I read and understood what the task was all about, i decided to first come up with an interface that cam full represent the scope/context. i designed it to be interactive and user friendly.

The very first page of the application summarise every functionalities of the web application.

it shows the number of clicks on the web page, it shows the total number of sectors added manually (not from .csv file), it displays the total number of interactons on the platform and it also show the percentage of each sector interations and analysed by pie chart,

For user to add interaction logs to this very well application, it can be done in two ways;-

1. By adding data manually if need be. and the sectors can also be stored into database and this will automatically come up for user to select when entry new data. This will help to accept new sectors in to the application without having to code it into the system by a programer.

2. By uploading the .csv file and all the information will go into our database as it is on the file.


The information added can be seen by clicking on the "Manage Data" and "Manage Sector" on these pages, one can  view all the informations added and add more as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This application can further be improved by making it so flexible that one can modifiy wrong details mistakenly entered, delete and for the users of the application to be able to save information present on the system in all extention format(.pdf, .csv etc). files backup implementation, more concrete details should be requires from clients like email, phone number (this can help keep good customer relationship as this can help bring more values on our daily interation and for good record keeping e.t.c), notification systems should br added to the system. Admins on the application should be trackable by their activities on the web application (they need to have their unique ID for activity reference). I  believe these and many other ideas that may arise as the project progress will help improve it more.




Thank you for giving me the opportunity.
